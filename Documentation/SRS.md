#### Vision

Employee Management is a web based 
application for managing employees,
departments and vacation.

The application consists of two parts: frontend and backend.

Backend - API that processes requests and works with the database.

Frontend - visual display of content.

**Application should provide:** 

    - Storing information about the employee's salary
    
    - Show employee list
   
    - Show list of departments
   
    - Updating the list of employees (adding, deleting, editing)
    
    - Show which department the employee belongs to


#### 1. Department 

This mode is intended for viewing the list of departments, description, creation date, update date.


#### 2. Employees 

The mode is intended for displaying the list of employees, their salaries, department, job assignment and position


#### 3. Vacation
